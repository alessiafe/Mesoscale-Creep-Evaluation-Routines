# Viscoelastic Creep Evaluation Routine 

This repository contains routines related to the viscoelastic experiments.  

## Folder structure  

- **`Creep_Tests_Dataset`**  
  Dataset folder with all experiments, sorted by sample and test type. Each file contains multiple sheets (one per sample). The dataset also includes results of tensile elastic tests [Ferrara and Wittel, 2024](), and Dynamic Vapor Sorption (DVS). DOI: [10.17632/vmvpvjj4g3.2](https://doi.org/10.17632/vmvpvjj4g3.2)  

- **Creep_tests_Ferrara_Wittel_2025**  
  Jupyter notebook provided as an analysis tool to sort and plot the experimental results. DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.14002650](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14002650)
