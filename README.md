# Creep Evaluation Routines  

This repository collects routines and datasets related to the evaluation of **viscoelastic** and **mechanosorptive creep** experiments on Norway spruce tissue slices.  

## Folder structure

- **`ve_matlab_prony_fitting`** → MATLAB routines for fitting viscoelastic creep data with a Kelvin–Voigt (Prony series) model. 
- **`ve_creep_python_routine`** → Jupyter notebooks and datasets for plotting viscoelastic creep results.  
- **`ms_creep_python_routine`** → Jupyter notebooks and datasets for processing and plotting mechanosorptive creep results.  

Each subfolder contains its own README file with detailed instructions and workflows.
